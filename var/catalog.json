It's so perfect for curling up on a chilly day. I wore it hiking on a really cold day last November and it kept me really warm. My only issue is that it's kind of plain and unflattering. I would love to wear it all the time but it makes me look a little frumpy. Luma, I need this fabric with a more stylish design!","nickname":"Martina","review_entity":"product","review_type":3,"review_status":1,"created_at":"2017-11-06 12:17:45","store_id":1,"stores":[0,1],"product_id":1,"tsk":1556379376640}}
